# Monte Carlo Options Calculator

Here is an application of Monte Carlo Simulations to try and provide insight on whether your options spreads are going to be in or out of the money. All you need to do is provide a stock ticker and your spread info and the page will provide you with a couple of different simulations telling you how likely it is for your spread to be profitable.

### Breakdown of the Page

At the top of the page you just need to enter the ticker for the stock that you're interested in.

The page then provides you with various stats about the stock

The first simulation uses the stocks compound annual growth and annual volatility to generate it's predictions. This is useful for when you think the stock is not going to experience any drastic movements.

The second simulation boostraps the historical returns to fit a statistical distribution to forecast the stock's movement. This model is more volatile, predicting larger spikes and dips in the stock's movements.

The settings on the side of the page should be fine for most usecases but feel free to change them to see other possible results.
